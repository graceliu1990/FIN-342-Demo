# FIN-342-Demo
This serves to overview the basics of GitHub, and expose the class to GitHub functionality.

Specifically, we will be looking at how to fork repositories (branch them), edit them, and then push changes to the master repository (branch). 

To do this, students will fork the master branch and comment in the following information:

    # Program (i.e. BBA, MBA)
    # uniquename
    # Favorite class in college (i.e. COMPLXSYS 391)
    # Favorite food
    
After this, the branches will be pushed back and used to update the master branch
This should ultimately create a nice class repository, and show basic GitHub operations
Along with showing why GitHub is useful when working on files with multiple people
